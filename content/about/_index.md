## Companion to the STAMPED paper

This site is the companion resource to our paper on idiomatic dataset version
control. While the paper develops the theoretical framework and evaluates
existing tools against it, this site provides the practical side: concrete,
runnable examples that show how the principles look when applied to real data
management tasks.

## STAMPED and YODA

The [YODA principles](https://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-127-yoda.html)
(YODA's Organigram on Data Analysis) established foundational conventions for
structuring DataLad datasets. STAMPED extends and generalizes those ideas
beyond any single tool:

- Where YODA focuses on DataLad dataset organization, STAMPED principles
  formalize **properties of a research object** that make YODA effective and
  express them in a tool-agnostic way.
- STAMPED adds principles (such as [Ephemerality]({{< ref "stamped_principles/e" >}}) and [Distributability]({{< ref "stamped_principles/d" >}})) that were
  implicit in YODA practice but not explicitly named.
- By decoupling the principles from a specific tool, STAMPED provides a
  vocabulary for evaluating *any* dataset management approach -- whether built
  on DataLad, DVC, Git LFS, Hugging Face Datasets, or plain Git with
  conventions.

## Multi-dimensional taxonomy

Examples on this site are organized along four independent dimensions:

1. **[STAMPED principles]({{< ref "stamped_principles" >}})** -- [Self-containment]({{< ref "stamped_principles/s" >}}), [Tracking]({{< ref "stamped_principles/t" >}}), [Actionability]({{< ref "stamped_principles/a" >}}),
   [Modularity]({{< ref "stamped_principles/m" >}}), [Portability]({{< ref "stamped_principles/p" >}}), [Ephemerality]({{< ref "stamped_principles/e" >}}), and [Distributability]({{< ref "stamped_principles/d" >}}).
2. **[FAIR mapping]({{< ref "fair_principles" >}})** -- which of the FAIR goals ([Findable]({{< ref "fair_principles/f" >}}), [Accessible]({{< ref "fair_principles/a" >}}),
   [Interoperable]({{< ref "fair_principles/i" >}}), [Reusable]({{< ref "fair_principles/r" >}})) the practice supports.
3. **[Instrumentation level]({{< ref "instrumentation_levels" >}})** -- ranging from [conventions]({{< ref "instrumentation_levels/data-organization" >}}) that require no
   special tooling, through lightweight [tools]({{< ref "instrumentation_levels/tool" >}}), to full version-control
   [workflows]({{< ref "instrumentation_levels/workflow" >}}).
4. **[Aspirational goals]({{< ref "aspirations" >}})** -- higher-level objectives such as [reproducibility]({{< ref "aspirations/reproducibility" >}}),
   [rigor]({{< ref "aspirations/rigor" >}}), [transparency]({{< ref "aspirations/transparency" >}}), and [efficiency]({{< ref "aspirations/efficiency" >}}).

An example may be tagged with multiple values in each dimension. A README
convention, for instance, supports Self-containment *and* Findability *and*
Reusability while requiring no special instrumentation.

## Range of examples

Examples span a wide range of complexity:

- **Simple conventions** -- directory layouts, naming schemes, README templates
  that require nothing more than discipline.
- **Lightweight practices** -- using checksums, manifests, or small scripts to
  add provenance without heavy infrastructure.
- **Tool-assisted workflows** -- leveraging Git, Git-annex, DataLad, DVC, or
  similar tools for automated tracking and distribution.
- **Advanced pipelines** -- multi-step, multi-tool workflows that demonstrate
  several STAMPED principles working together.
