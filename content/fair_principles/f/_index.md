title: "Findable"
description: "Data and metadata should be easy to find, with rich metadata and unique persistent identifiers"
---

The first FAIR principle states that data and metadata should be easy to find for both humans and machines. This requires:

- Assigning globally unique and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to data and metadata.
- Describing data with rich metadata.
- Registering or indexing data in searchable resources.
- Including the identifier in the metadata so the connection is explicit.

In the context of STAMPED, findability is supported by practices such as structured directory layouts, consistent naming conventions, machine-readable metadata files, and the use of version control systems that provide stable references to specific states of a dataset.
