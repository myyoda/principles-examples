title: "Interoperable"
description: "Data should use formal, shared vocabularies and reference other data"
---

The Interoperable principle ensures that data can be integrated with other data and can work with applications and workflows for analysis, storage, and processing. This means:

- Using a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- Using vocabularies that follow FAIR principles themselves.
- Including qualified references to other datasets and metadata.

In STAMPED terms, interoperability is promoted by adopting standard file formats, using community-accepted metadata schemas, structuring data so that it can be combined across studies, and maintaining explicit links between datasets and their dependencies. Version control and provenance tracking make these cross-references robust and verifiable.
