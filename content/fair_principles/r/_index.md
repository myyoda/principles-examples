title: "Reusable"
description: "Data should be richly described with clear provenance and licensing for reuse"

The Reusable principle aims to ensure that data and metadata are well-described so they can be used and combined in future research. This requires:

- Describing data with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes.
- Releasing data with a clear and accessible data usage license.
- Associating data with detailed provenance information.
- Meeting domain-relevant community standards for data and metadata.

STAMPED practices directly support reusability through comprehensive provenance tracking, machine-readable metadata, explicit licensing, and modular data organization. When every processing step is recorded and the full history of a dataset is available, other researchers can confidently reuse and build upon the work.
