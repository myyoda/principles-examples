title: "FAIR Principles"
description: "Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable -- complementary goals that STAMPED engineering practices help achieve"
---

The **FAIR Principles** provide a set of guiding goals for scientific data management:

- **[Findable](f/)** -- Data and metadata should be easy to find, with rich metadata and unique persistent identifiers.
- **[Accessible](a/)** -- Data should be retrievable via standardized protocols, with clear access conditions.
- **[Interoperable](i/)** -- Data should use formal, shared vocabularies and reference other data.
- **[Reusable](r/)** -- Data should be richly described with clear provenance and licensing for reuse.

FAIR and STAMPED are complementary. FAIR describes *what* good data management looks like from the consumer's perspective, while STAMPED focuses on the *engineering practices* that help achieve those goals from the producer's perspective. A project that follows STAMPED principles will naturally tend toward FAIR compliance, because practices like version control, structured metadata, provenance tracking, and standardized organization directly support findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability.
