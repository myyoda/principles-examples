title: "E — Ephemerality"
description: "Derived and regenerable content should be treated as ephemeral"

Derived and regenerable content should be treated as **ephemeral**. If a file
can be recomputed from tracked inputs and recorded commands, it need not be
stored permanently. This principle keeps repositories lean and focuses
preservation on irreplaceable data and the provenance needed to regenerate
everything else.

Ephemerality draws a practical distinction between data that must be preserved
and data that can be recreated. Raw experimental measurements, manually curated
annotations, and one-time observations are irreplaceable and deserve permanent
storage. Statistical summaries, processed images, and compiled reports can be
regenerated from those inputs if the processing steps are recorded (see
[Actionability](../a/) and [Tracking](../t/)).

By treating regenerable content as ephemeral, datasets remain manageable in size
and storage costs stay proportional to the actual information content rather than
to every intermediate artifact ever produced.
