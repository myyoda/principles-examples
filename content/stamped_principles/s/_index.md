A dataset should be a **self-contained unit** that includes everything needed to
understand and use its contents. Metadata, provenance information, and
documentation travel with the data, not in external systems. When you clone or
copy a dataset, you get the complete picture.

Self-containment means that a dataset does not depend on an external wiki, a
shared spreadsheet, or institutional memory for its interpretation. The data
files, the description of what they contain, the record of where they came from,
and the instructions for how to use them are all part of the same versioned
package.

This principle has practical consequences: if a collaborator receives a copy of
your dataset, they should be able to understand its structure and provenance
without asking you questions. If an archival system ingests your dataset years
from now, the necessary context is already present.
