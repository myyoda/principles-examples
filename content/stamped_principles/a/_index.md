title: "A — Actionable"
description: "Procedures are executable specifications, not just documentation"
---

Actionability elevates a research object from a static collection of metadata to
an operational unit. A research object is actionable when its procedures can be
carried out by executing its contents -- not merely read about.

Actionability is **cross-cutting**: it applies to every other STAMPED dimension.
Tracking is more actionable when recorded commands can be re-executed (e.g.,
`datalad rerun`), not just inspected. Modularity is more actionable when
components can be composed via tooling (e.g., `git submodule`), not just
organized into directories. Portability is more actionable when environments can
be instantiated from a specification (e.g., `singularity run`), not just
documented in a README.

See the [STAMPED paper](https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper) for the
full treatment.
