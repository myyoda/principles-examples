title: "Instrumentation Levels"
description: "The spectrum from lightweight conventions to full automation in data management"

Instrumentation levels describe the degree of tooling and automation applied to data management practices. They form a spectrum from simple conventions that require no special software to sophisticated automated workflows:

- **[Data Organization](data-organization/)** -- Directory layouts, naming conventions, file organization patterns. The foundation that requires no special tools.
- **[Tool](tool/)** -- Specific software tools that implement principles (git, git-annex, DataLad, etc.). Single-purpose utilities that address particular needs.
- **[Workflow](workflow/)** -- Multi-step pipelines combining tools. Orchestrated sequences for data processing, analysis, and publication.
- **[Pattern](pattern/)** -- Architectural design patterns applied to data management. Higher-level organizational strategies that guide how tools and workflows are composed.

Not every project needs full automation. The appropriate level of instrumentation depends on the project's scale, complexity, and collaboration requirements. Even the simplest level -- thoughtful data organization -- delivers significant benefits. Each subsequent level builds on the ones below it, adding capabilities while also adding complexity.
