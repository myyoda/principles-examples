The Pattern instrumentation level represents architectural design patterns applied to data management. Just as software engineering has patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) that guide system design, data management has higher-level organizational strategies that guide how datasets, tools, and workflows are composed.

Examples of data management patterns:

- **YODA (YODAs Organizer of Data Assets)** -- A pattern for structuring nested datasets with clear separation of inputs, outputs, and code, enabling modular and portable analyses.
- **BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure)** -- A community standard for organizing neuroimaging data with prescribed directory structures, naming conventions, and metadata files.
- **Linked dataset graphs** -- Connecting datasets as a directed acyclic graph of dependencies, so that provenance flows naturally through the structure.

Patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than individual tools or workflows. They provide a mental model and a set of conventions that make it easier to reason about, communicate about, and maintain complex data management setups over time.
