description: "The aspirational goals that STAMPED principles and good data management practices serve"

Aspirations are the higher-level goals that motivate the adoption of STAMPED principles and structured data management. They represent the qualities that researchers strive for in their work:

- **[Reproducibility](reproducibility/)** -- The ability to reproduce results exactly. Re-running the same analysis on the same data yields identical outcomes.
- **[Rigor](rigor/)** -- Methodological rigor and correctness. Ensuring that data management practices support sound scientific methodology.
- **[Transparency](transparency/)** -- Openness and clarity of the research process. Making it clear what was done, how, and why.
- **[Efficiency](efficiency/)** -- Practical efficiency of data management workflows. Minimizing friction and overhead so researchers can focus on science.

These aspirations are not mutually exclusive; they reinforce each other. Transparent processes tend to be more reproducible. Rigorous methods tend to be more efficient in the long run because they prevent costly errors. STAMPED principles provide concrete practices that advance all of these goals simultaneously.
