Efficiency in data management means minimizing the friction and overhead of organizing, finding, processing, and sharing data so that researchers can spend their time on science rather than on data wrangling.

Efficient data management practices include:

- **Automation** -- Scripted pipelines that eliminate repetitive manual steps.
- **Clear organization** -- Consistent structures that make it easy to find what you need without searching.
- **Reusable components** -- Modular datasets and code that can be composed into new analyses without starting from scratch.
- **Streamlined collaboration** -- Standard formats and tools that reduce the cost of sharing data between people and systems.

STAMPED principles contribute to efficiency by establishing conventions up front that prevent costly disorganization later. The initial investment in structure, tooling, and automation pays dividends as projects grow, teams change, and data is reused across studies. What looks like overhead at the start becomes a significant time saver over the lifetime of a research project.
