description: "Openness and clarity of the research process -- making it clear what was done, how, and why"

Transparency means that the research process is open and comprehensible to others (and to your future self). A transparent project makes it clear:

- **What** data was collected or used.
- **How** it was processed, transformed, and analyzed.
- **Why** particular decisions were made along the way.
- **Where** the data and code can be found.

STAMPED principles support transparency through detailed provenance records, human-readable metadata, public version control histories, and well-documented data organization. When every step of a research project is recorded and accessible, collaborators and reviewers can follow the entire chain from raw data to published results. Transparency builds trust and enables meaningful peer review of not just the conclusions, but the process that produced them.
